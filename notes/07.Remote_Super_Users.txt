Remote Super Users :
--------------------
Delete Users : use 'DROP USER user'
Note : 'DROP USER' performs a GRANT TABLEs flush or 'FLUSH PRIVILEGES'

mysql > drop user cofee ;
mysql > drop user '';
mysql > drop user '%';

Task : Create users who are permitted remote access from '<remotehost>'
1. Create a user called 'root'
Note : Use FQDN when creating users for remote access and/or IP address
Note : Define 2 users for failover or name resolution breakdown.

mysql > grant all privileges on *.* to 'root'@'<remotehost>' identified by 'niceteeth';   ---> Provide the FQDN at the hostname.

Go to the remote system and connect to mysql
# mysql -h <localhost>
