Privileges - REVOKE :
---------------------
mysql > CREATE user nucguy3;
mysql > GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO nocguy3@dev1 IDENTIFIED by 'xyz123';
Note: If we didn't create a password while creating the user by using CREATE USER 
	the password for the user will be empty / null / no password

REVOKE - allows us to revoke access
Syntax mimics GRANT command

mysql > show grants for nocguy3;
mysql > REVOKE ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* FROM nocguy3@dev1 IDENTIFIED BY 'xyz123';

Remove / Drop users :
mysql > drop user nocguy;

Remove / Drop multiple users :
mysql > drop user nocguy1, nocguy2, nocguy3;

Note : While dropping the user the privileges of that user will also be flushed.
