Privileges - Grant :
--------------------

Task : Use the GRANT routine to create various users with various privileges.
1. Create a user named 'arjun' with full privileges minus GRANT option.

mysql > GRANT ALL on *.* to 'arjun'@'localhost' identified by 'xyz123';
mysql > select user, host, Create_priv, Alert_priv from mysql.user;


2. Create a user named 'nocguy' with no privileges.
This can be used when we need to create number of users. So we can GRANT permissions for the created users later on. 

mysql > GRANT USAGE on *.* to nocguy identified by 'xyz123';


3. Create a user name 'nocguy1' with full privileges to test DB
mysql > GRANT ALL on test.* to nocguy1 identified by 'xyz123';
mysql > use mysql;
mysql > select * from db;


Now for the user 'arjun' we have all privileges other than GRANT. So we'll try to login as arjun and create another user.

# mysql -u arjun -p
mysql > GRANT ALL ON *.* to omkar identified by 'xyz123';

We'll get an error as we don't have GRANT access for 'arjun'
