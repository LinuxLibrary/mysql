Drop Anonymous :
----------------
Increase DBMS security by removing anonymous accounts:
1. Use 'DELETE' statement to remove anonymous accounts.
'DELETE from mysql.user WHERE user = '';'
2. Confirm that anonymous accounts have been removed
4. Simply attempting to connect to MySQL using mysql client from localhost.
5. Don't forget to execute 'FLUSH PRIVILEGES'

mysql > DELETE from mysql.user WHERE user = '';
mysql > FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
mysql > select user,host,password from mysql.user;
$ mysql -p
Note: Now you should not be able to login as anonymous user.
