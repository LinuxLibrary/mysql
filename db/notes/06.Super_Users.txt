Super Users : 
-------------

Note : % = wild card in SQL notation

mysql > show grants;	---> Shows grants for the user currently logged in.

Create additional MySQL users:
1. Create a new Super-User, who can use MySQL from any system
 a. GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON*.* TO 'arjun'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'xyz123' WITH GRANT OPTION;
mysql > select user,host,password from user;
2. Test local and remote connectivity.
   Connect to the DB with the user created and verify it.
mysql > show grants;

If we want to permit every user from any host with full permissions then we can use the below but ont thing is it is very dangerous.
mysql > grant all privileges on *.* to '%'@'%' identified by 'xyz123';
